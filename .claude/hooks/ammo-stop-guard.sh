# Stop hook — AMMO orchestrator continuation nudge.

# Fires for the ORCHESTRATOR (not teammates) when campaign artifacts exist
# and work remains. Exits silently when:
#   - No state.json in kernel_opt_artifacts/
#   - Campaign is terminal (complete/exhausted) AND REPORT.md exists
#
# Nudges at:
#   - Stage 7 (active): proceed to next round or set terminal status + 7b
#   - Stage 7 (terminal, no report): spawn report subagent (closes the 7b gap)
#   - Stage 7b: spawn report subagent
#
# Teammates are excluded via the agent_type JSON field (present for subagents,
# absent for the lead) with a fallback to session_id / team-config check.
#
# Uses file-based one-shot circuit breaker (keyed by session_id):
#   1st stop attempt: create marker file, nudge with stage-specific prompt
#   2nd stop attempt: marker file exists → allow through
