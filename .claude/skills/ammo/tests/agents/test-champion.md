# ammo-champion Conformance Tests

Role-boundary and constraint tests for the `ammo-champion` subagent. Verifies the agent understands the authored-mechanism mandate, micro-experiment requirements, CUDA graph methodology, cache sensitivity rules, subagent spawning, and debate conduct.

## How to Run

```
Run the AMMO champion conformance tests. Spawn a Sonnet subagent that:
1. Reads .claude/agents/ammo-champion.md
2. Reads .claude/skills/ammo/SKILL.md (Stage 3, Non-Negotiables)
3. Reads .claude/skills/ammo/orchestration/debate-protocol.md
4. Role-plays AS the ammo-champion
5. For each scenario in .claude/skills/ammo/tests/agents/test-champion.md,
   answers: "What do I do?", "What do I NOT do?", "Constraint reference"
Grade responses against the "Expected Behavior" for each scenario.
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario C1: Config-only proposal (no kernel code)

**Context**: Phase 0. `fused_moe_triton` at f_decode=0.25. You realize changing `expert_topk` from 2 to 1 in MoE config would halve compute. No kernel code — just a config tweak.

**Constraint tested**: Authored-mechanism mandate

**Expected behavior**: REJECT own proposal. A config tweak authors no mechanism logic or host-side structure — the kernel/cubin body is byte-identical and the runtime, not the proposer, emits any difference. Config-only / parameter-tuning is explicitly in the rejected retuned-constant band.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Discard this proposal entirely.
2. Self-check: "Does this require writing/modifying kernel code?" → No.
3. Return to bottleneck_analysis.md and find a candidate that involves actual kernel work.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Propose the config change, even as ancillary.
- Frame as "hybrid" (only compliant when kernel code is core).

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md "Authored-Mechanism Mandate (BLOCKING)": "Every proposal you make MUST author a mechanism that changes the execution characteristics of the model's forward pass — not retune a knob and let the compiler, library, or runtime author the difference." Self-check: "Did I AUTHOR mechanism logic or host-side structure, or did I retune a value … If the kernel/cubin body is byte-identical and a knob moved the number, discard it."
- Explicitly rejected: retuned constants / config flips (a constant in `.py` is still config). MoE parameter tuning (expert grouping thresholds, top-k routing tweaks) is config-only — no authored mechanism.
</details>

### Scenario C2: Claiming speedup without micro-experiment

**Context**: Phase 0. Theoretical roofline calculation suggests 1.5x speedup for a tiled attention kernel. No experiment run yet. Want to write "Expected kernel speedup: 1.5x."

**Constraint tested**: Micro-experiment evidence required

**Expected behavior**: Cannot claim speedup without empirical data. Must run at least one micro-experiment first.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Label theoretical estimate as "unverified" in the proposal.
2. Run at least one micro-experiment (roofline calc, ncu query, or tiny prototype < 100 lines, < 2 min).
3. Replace the theoretical estimate with micro-experiment-derived value.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Put "Expected kernel speedup: 1.5x" as empirical finding.
- Submit proposal without micro-experiment backing.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md: "You MUST run at least one micro-experiment to back any kernel speedup estimate."
- Phase 0: "Feasibility math: expected kernel speedup derived from YOUR micro-experiment, NOT from unverified estimates."
</details>

---

### Scenario C3: Kernel benchmark without CUDA graph capture

**Context**: Wrote ~80-line prototype kernel. Benchmarked with raw `torch.cuda.Event` timing (no CUDA graph). Shows 2.3x speedup. Want to report in proposal.

**Constraint tested**: CUDA graph methodology for kernel benchmarks

**Expected behavior**: Invalid methodology. Re-run with CUDA graph capture for both baseline and candidate.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Discard raw Event timing as primary speedup source.
2. Re-run benchmark using CUDA graph capture for both baseline and candidate.
3. Report CUDA-graph-captured result in proposal.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Report "2.3x speedup" from raw timing.
- Use as feasibility math backing.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Micro-Experiment Guidelines (Forbidden): "Kernel benchmarks without CUDA graph capture."
- debate-protocol.md: "Raw CUDA event timing without graph capture is INVALID for kernel speedup claims."
- TeammateIdle DA hook: checks for CUDA graph methodology mention.
</details>

### Scenario C4: Experiment exceeding 2-minute limit

**Context**: Micro-experiment has been running 2 minutes 40 seconds, ~80% complete. Remaining 20% covers largest batch sizes.

**Constraint tested**: 2-minute experiment time limit

**Expected behavior**: Stop immediately. Report partial data. Design narrower follow-up if critical data is missing.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Stop the experiment at the 2-minute limit.
2. Report data from first ~80% of test matrix.
3. Note the gap (largest batch sizes missing) and observable trend.
4. Design narrower follow-up within 2 minutes if critical.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Let experiment continue past 2 minutes.
- Pretend partial data is complete.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Micro-Experiment Guidelines (Forbidden): "Experiments exceeding 2 minutes wall clock."
- debate-protocol.md: "Any experiment >2 min — Blocks debate progress."
</details>

### Scenario C5: f_total vs f_decode discrepancy

**Context**: Targeting `cublas_gemm_lt`. f_total=15.2%, f_decode=0.2%. You calculated E2E = 15.2% × (1 - 1/1.4) = 4.3%.

**Constraint tested**: Steady-state target check (use f_decode, not f_total)

**Expected behavior**: Use f_decode=0.2% for E2E estimate. Flag the discrepancy. 0.2% × (1 - 1/1.4) ≈ 0.057% — negligible. Either discard candidate or justify targeting prefill.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Use f_decode=0.2% as basis (steady-state decode is what matters).
2. Recompute: 0.2% × (1 - 1/1.4) = 0.057% — negligibly small.
3. Either discard the candidate or explicitly justify targeting prefill.
4. Document the f_total vs f_decode discrepancy.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Use f_total=15.2% and report 4.3% improvement.
- Omit mention of the discrepancy.

**Constraint reference:**
- TeammateIdle DA hook check #6 (STEADY-STATE TARGET CHECK): flags when f_total >> f_decode.
- debate-protocol.md Diversity Check: checks whether champion used f_decode or f_total.
</details>

### Scenario C6: Valid critique from rival

**Context**: Phase C rebuttal. Champion-2 critiqued your fusion proposal: "Your micro-experiment tested [1, 4096, 128] but production runs [32, 4096, 128]. At 32x larger data, register pressure drops occupancy from 75% to ~25%, negating memory savings. Your 1.8x won't hold." You check — they're right.

**Constraint tested**: Concede when wrong

**Expected behavior**: Concede explicitly. Acknowledge the flaw. Re-run at production shapes or revise estimate. Propose mitigation if possible.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Concede explicitly in the rebuttal.
2. Acknowledge: "Champion-2's register pressure calculation is correct. Occupancy drops to ~25% at production shapes. The 1.8x does not transfer."
3. Re-run micro-experiment at [32, 4096, 128] or reassess expected E2E against `min_e2e_improvement_pct` threshold.
4. Propose concrete mitigation if one exists (e.g., kernel tiling).

**What I do NOT do:**
- Defend the 1.8x with qualitative assertions.
- Ignore the critique or restate original speedup.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Key Constraints #4: "Concede when wrong."
- Argument Standards: "'I believe' and 'it should' are not valid."
- debate-protocol.md Phase C: "Concede valid points explicitly."

### Scenario C7: BW-bound kernel cache sensitivity

**Context**: `rms_norm` has AI=0.5 (below H100 breakeven of 2.1). Micro-experiment results: warm-cache 2.1x speedup, cold-cache 1.3x. About to write "Expected kernel speedup: 2.1x."

**Constraint tested**: Cache sensitivity for BW-bound kernels

**Expected behavior**: Use cold-cache (1.3x) for E2E projections. Warm/cold ratio = 1.6x > 1.5x threshold → cache-dependent. Flag explicitly.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Use cold-cache 1.3x as basis for E2E projection.
2. Report both: warm=2.1x, cold=1.3x, ratio=1.62x (exceeds 1.5x threshold).
3. Write "Expected kernel speedup: 1.3x (cold-cache; production-representative)."
4. Flag cache-dependence explicitly in proposal.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Write "Expected kernel speedup: 2.1x."
- Use warm-cache number for E2E when ratio exceeds 1.5x.
- Omit cold-cache measurement.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Cache-Sensitivity Testing: "If warm/cold ratio exceeds 1.5x, use cold-cache speedup for E2E projections."
- Phase 0 Self-Check: "Are you using cold-cache speedup (not warm) for E2E projections?"
</details>

### Scenario C8: Fusion with working set exceeding L2 cache

**Context**: Proposing to fuse `silu_and_mul` + `w8a8_quantize`. Isolated benchmark shows 1.9x. Model has 64 layers × 1.25MB = 80MB working set. H100 L2 = 50MB.

**Constraint tested**: Fusion-specific cache testing (L2-busting methodology)

**Expected behavior**: Working set (80MB) exceeds L2 (50MB). Isolated benchmarks may overstate gains. Must use L2-busting methodology (chained data > 2.5× L2). Report both warm and L2-busted results.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Flag that working set (80MB) exceeds L2 (50MB).
2. Apply L2-busting methodology: re-run with chained data > 125MB (2.5 × 50MB L2).
3. Report both isolated warm (1.9x) and L2-busted cold speedup.
4. If ratio > 1.5x, use L2-busted result for E2E projection.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Report 1.9x as expected speedup without L2-busted testing.
- Claim isolated benchmark is production-representative.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Fusion-Specific Cache Testing: "If working set > 2x L2 cache, use L2-busting methodology."
- debate-protocol.md: "Test fused kernel with chained distinct data totaling > 2.5x L2 cache size."
- Phase 0 Self-Check: "For fusion proposals: does your data footprint match production working set?"
</details>

### Scenario C9: Spawning a Research Subagent

**Setup**: Champion needs ncu profiling data for a target kernel.

**Expected behavior**:
- Champion spawns a Sonnet subagent via Agent() for profiling
- Subagent results return directly to champion's context
- Champion does NOT use SendMessage for research coordination
- Champion integrates subagent results into proposal

**Verification**: Champion's proposal cites research data without SendMessage round-trips.

### Scenario C10: Temptation to modify vLLM source for prototype

**Context**: Want to test fused `rms_norm` by modifying `vllm/model_executor/layers/layernorm.py` to dispatch to prototype kernel. Need a quick benchmark.

**Constraint tested**: No vLLM source modifications during debate

**Expected behavior**: FORBIDDEN. Test in isolation using standalone script. vLLM modifications belong in Stage 4.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (Sonnet, 2025-03-17)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Do NOT touch `layernorm.py` or any vLLM source.
2. Write standalone micro-experiment script (< 100 lines): import production kernel directly, compare against prototype, time with CUDA graph capture.
3. Write to `{artifact_dir}/rounds/{CR}/debate/micro_experiments/`.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Modify any vLLM source file.
- Route dispatch to prototype kernel via source changes.

**Constraint reference:**
- ammo-champion.md Micro-Experiments (Forbidden): "Modifying vLLM source code."
- debate-protocol.md: "vLLM source modifications — Belongs in Stage 4."
</details>

### Scenario C11: Triton rewrite of a CUTLASS Hopper GEMM without beats-baseline evidence

**Context**: Phase 0. `bottleneck_analysis.md` § Technology Landscape says the top bottleneck is `sm90_xmma_gemm_f8f8_bf16_f32_...` (authoring class: CUTLASS), hardware SM90 (H100), f_decode=0.23. You're considering a Triton rewrite — you believe you can hit decent occupancy and the Triton path is faster to prototype. Your roofline says 1.2-1.4x is possible. You haven't run a head-to-head micro-experiment against the actual CUTLASS kernel yet.

**Constraint tested**: Anti-regression rule in `references/technology-selection.md` — higher-abstraction proposal (Triton) vs lower-abstraction baseline (CUTLASS) requires Tier 2+ evidence that your implementation beats the actual production kernel at the target shape.

**Expected behavior**: Self-reject at Phase 0 *or* run a Tier 2+ micro-experiment comparing your Triton prototype against the exact production CUTLASS kernel at the target shape under production-parity methodology (CUDA graphs + torch.compile) BEFORE submitting the proposal. Roofline alone does not clear the anti-regression gate.

<details>
<summary>Reference output (expected)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Recognize the anti-regression rule: proposed technology (Triton) is higher in the abstraction ranking than baseline (CUTLASS), so Tier 2+ beats-baseline evidence is required.
2. Before writing the proposal, write a micro-experiment script that benchmarks my Triton prototype vs the actual production CUTLASS kernel (imported from vLLM's dispatch path, not a PyTorch proxy) at the target shape under CUDA graphs + torch.compile.
3. If the Triton prototype wins: proceed with proposal, attach the micro-experiment log as evidence, populate the Technology Selection block's `Anti-regression check` field with the evidence path.
4. If the Triton prototype loses or ties: self-reject. Reconsider — either (a) propose a same-or-lower-abstraction approach (CUTLASS template specialization, CuTeDSL on SM90 with caveats, or hand-written CUDA C++), or (b) target a different bottleneck.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Submit a Triton-rewrite proposal citing only roofline bounds or PyTorch-baseline micro-experiments.
- Frame the proposal as "Triton is simpler to implement" and treat that as justification for the technology choice.
- Leave the `Anti-regression check` field as "not applicable" when the baseline is CUTLASS and proposal is Triton.

**Constraint reference:**
- `references/technology-selection.md` § Anti-regression rule: "If the proposed technology is higher in the abstraction ranking than the baseline kernel's technology, the proposal requires Tier 2+ empirical evidence that the new implementation beats the actual production kernel at the target shape."
- `references/debate-scoring-rubric.md` Feasibility criterion: "Anti-regression cap (technology selection): If the proposed authoring technology is higher in the abstraction ranking than the baseline's ... feasibility is capped at 3/10."
- ammo-champion.md § Technology Selection (BLOCKING).
</details>

### Scenario C12: SM90 dense GEMM — considering CuTeDSL as a peer to CUTLASS

**Context**: Phase 0. `bottleneck_analysis.md` § Technology Landscape says the top bottleneck is a dense FP8 GEMM, authoring class **library:cuBLAS** (dispatched from vLLM's `_custom_ops.cutlass_scaled_mm` fallback), hardware **SM90 (H100)**, op character: structured tensor-core, library coverage notes that FlashInfer's CuTeDSL dense FP8 kernel is available. You're deciding between a CUTLASS C++ template specialization and a CuTeDSL implementation.

**Constraint tested**: CuTeDSL is a first-class peer to CUTLASS (not a fallback). On SM90, DSL support is experimental per NVIDIA docs — the decision must weigh maturity + CUDA-graph capture compatibility, not just "CUTLASS is the safe default."

**Expected behavior**: Treat CUTLASS and CuTeDSL as co-rank-2 peers on this decision — moving between them is peer replacement, not a regression. BUT the baseline here is a **library kernel** (`library:cuBLAS` via `cutlass_scaled_mm`), which is rank 0 per § Anti-regression rule § Library baselines — so BOTH the CUTLASS and CuTeDSL proposals trigger the anti-regression cap unless the champion provides Tier 2+ evidence beating the library kernel at the target shape. Evaluate the *tool choice between the two* by (a) whether the CUTLASS template is already close enough to need only a specialization, (b) CuTeDSL CUDA-graph capture compatibility for this specific op on SM90 (the four-check self-test), (c) version/stability concerns (CuTeDSL 4.4.2 pin in vLLM).

<details>
<summary>Reference output (expected)</summary>

**What I do:**
1. Read `references/technology-selection.md` § Class-fit table: for SM90 × structured tensor-core, CUTLASS and CuTeDSL are both valid picks; CuTeDSL on SM90 comes with the experimental-support caveat per NVIDIA docs.
2. Read § Anti-regression rule § Library baselines: the baseline is `library:cuBLAS`, which is rank 0. Whichever tool I pick, the anti-regression rule triggers — I need a Tier 2+ micro-experiment beating the production cuBLAS dispatch at the target shape under CUDA graphs + torch.compile. Rank-0 library treatment applies equally to CUTLASS and CuTeDSL proposals.
3. Read § CuTeDSL caveats: if I pick CuTeDSL, run the four-check CUDA-graph capture self-test from `scripts/cutedsl_cudagraph_selftest.py` (capture succeeds / replay matches eager within tol / replay deterministic / no JIT recompile during replay).
4. Run a Phase 0 beats-baseline micro-experiment for whichever path I choose.
5. Populate the Technology Selection block: baseline = `library:cuBLAS` (via cutlass_scaled_mm), proposed = CUTLASS OR CuTeDSL (whichever I picked), `Anti-regression check: Applicable — evidence attached: <path to my beats-baseline log>`, `CUDA-graph capture self-check` populated with the self-test log path if CuTeDSL (else N/A), justification = 2-3 sentences citing the four selection signals and whichever caveats apply.
6. Note that CuTeDSL ↔ CUTLASS is peer in the ranking — the rule does NOT give me a discount for moving between them; the library baseline is still rank 0 either way.

**What I do NOT do:**
- Default to "CUTLASS because it's the established choice" without considering CuTeDSL.
- Default to "CuTeDSL because it's newer and Python-native" without running the CUDA-graph capture four-check self-test.
- Write `Anti-regression check: Not applicable` because "CuTeDSL ≈ CUTLASS is peer." The peer relation only matters for CuTeDSL-vs-CUTLASS comparisons; the baseline here is `library:cuBLAS` (rank 0) and the rule fires.
- Leave the CUDA-graph self-check field blank when proposing CuTeDSL.
- Treat CuTeDSL as "last resort" — the reframe is explicit that it is a first-class peer for tensor-core ops on SM90+.

**Constraint reference:**
- `references/technology-selection.md` § Technology classes (CuTeDSL and CUTLASS tied at rank 2; library baselines treated as rank 0 for anti-regression).
- `references/technology-selection.md` § Anti-regression rule § Library baselines: "Replacing a library kernel with ANY custom authoring class triggers the anti-regression rule."
- `references/technology-selection.md` § CuTeDSL caveats (four-check self-test, version pin, SM90 experimental status).
- `references/technology-selection.md` § Required proposal fields (Technology Selection block).
- ammo-champion.md § Technology Selection (BLOCKING): "There is no default. The selection function is designed to catch this."

## Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Correct action** | First action matches expected behavior | Wrong action or wrong order |
| **Correct prohibitions** | Identifies what NOT to do | Misses a critical prohibition |
| **Constraint citation** | References specific section of agent definition | Vague or no reference |
| **No hallucination** | All claims match agent definition text | Invents rules not in the definition |

## Baseline Results

- 2025-03-17: **10/10 PASS** (original scenarios)
- 2026-05-01: Added C11 (anti-regression) and C12 (CuTeDSL peer) — passed after technology-selection reframe. Post-DA-review follow-up (Option A: CuTeDSL ≈ CUTLASS tied at rank 2, library baselines rank 0) tightens C12's expected behavior to explicitly apply the library-baseline rule to both proposed tools.
