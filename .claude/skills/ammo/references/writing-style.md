# Writing Style for AMMO Artifacts

Every markdown artifact you write — proposals, critiques, rebuttals, `validation_results.md`, monitor logs, decision records — is read **once, by one busy engineer, to make one decision**. Write for that reader, not for a grader tallying coverage.

The pipeline already proves your diligence structurally: a populated Technology Selection block, a passing gate, a cited log file. You do not earn anything by *narrating* that diligence in prose. Coverage, length, and visible effort are not scored (see `debate-scoring-rubric.md` § Scoring Is On Content, Not Volume). A staff engineer reviewing your doc would keep the numbers, the verdict, the non-obvious reasoning, and the evidence pointers — and delete roughly half of what these artifacts currently contain. Write the version they'd keep.

## The reader's test

Before you write a sentence, ask: *does this change what the reader does next?* If the same conclusion already appears above, if it restates a rule you're following, or if it announces your own honesty — it fails the test. Cut it.

## Rules

**State each conclusion once.** Put the verdict at the top, the evidence below it, and stop. Do not repeat it in YAML frontmatter *and* a bold `Verdict:` line *and* the end of every section *and* a closing "Recommendation." One `CLOSED` / `PASS` / `GATED_PASS`, in one place.

**Cite each number once, then refer to it by name.** Give a figure its source the first time (`file:line`, log path, or trace ref), then call it "the 4.12µs body" or "the BS1 win" afterward. Re-deriving the same µs figure in four sections is the single loudest slop signal in these documents.

**Bold budget: about five spans per document.** Reserve bold for the verdict and the one or two genuinely surprising facts. When the key phrase of every third sentence is bold, emphasis carries no signal. Never bold a whole multi-clause sentence.

**Never narrate honesty or candor.** Delete "honest," "honestly," "full disclosure," "I am explicit," "(read first)," "not advocacy," "self-falsification." State the caveat plainly — `The isolated 1.25µs is 2.7× faster than the trace; the gap is paged-cache scatter, not body compute.` is complete on its own. Framing it as a moral act adds words and subtracts credibility.

**Never echo the protocol you're following.** Write the evidence, not the rule the evidence satisfies. Cut "satisfying the Component Dismissal Standard's two-independent-results bar," "this is the document-the-loop justification the Diversity Check requires," "clears NN#8." The reader knows the rules; they want to know what you found. (Exception: the machine-parsed blocks below keep their exact labels — those are contracts, not prose.)

**Drop status-label theater and self-praise.** No `ADDRESSED` / `CONCEDED` / `REBUTTED` / `EXEMPLARY` / `textbook` stamps. In a rebuttal, just concede or counter the point in a sentence. In a monitor log, "no flags" is the finding, not "NO RED FLAGS observed — methodology sound throughout."

**Prefer short sentences to em-dash chains.** If a sentence has three em-dashes or nested parentheticals each re-qualifying the last, split it. One claim per sentence; put the qualification in the next sentence if it matters.

**Required disclosures go in fixed compact forms, not prose:**
- Methodology compliance → a one-line checklist: `parity ✓ (CUDA graphs + torch.compile) · warm+cold ✓ · baseline provenance ✓ (logs: …)`. This satisfies the feasibility caps; surrounding narrative earns nothing.
- Risks → a register table, ≤5 rows: `risk | likelihood | mitigation`.
- Fix attempts (impl FAIL paths) → one table row per attempt: `attempt | root cause | result`. Not a running narrative.
- Critiques addressed (rebuttal) → one row per critique: `critique | concede / rebut | one-line evidence`. A one-row concession fully counts as "addressed" — you do not need a paragraph per critique.

## Length targets

These are targets for the prose you author, *excluding* required machine-parsed blocks and data tables (those stay complete). Going over is a signal to cut narration, not to delete evidence.

| Artifact | Target |
|---|---|
| Proposal | ≤ 900 words + required blocks |
| Critique | ≤ 500 words |
| Rebuttal | ≤ 600 words (table per critique) |
| `validation_results.md` | ≤ 700 words + gate tables |
| Decision record | ≤ 500 words |
| Monitor poll, no findings | **one line**: `Poll 12 (lines 296–468): smoke test pass, no flags` |
| Monitor poll, finding | the DA-MONITOR message + one line of context |

A clean kill or a FAIL is not a license to write more to "prove" it — a well-supported negative is *shorter*, because the evidence is decisive. The OP-012 FAIL ran 2,000 words for a track with zero code written; the human version is the verdict, the two independent negatives in a table, and the fallback-ladder result — under one page.

## What you must NOT cut

Brevity never overrides a machine contract. These exact structures are parsed by gates, hooks, and the orchestrator — keep their headings and field labels verbatim:

- **Proposals**: the `Technology Selection` block, the `Precision Classification` field (`lossless`/`lossy` + dtype-rule citation), the `## Category` block with all five labeled fields, and the authored-mechanism description.
- **`validation_results.md`**: the Decision/Overall heading with an explicit `PASS`/`FAIL`/`GATED_PASS` token, the `## Gate 5.3` E2E table, the Files-modified / Scope-adherence list, and (for GATED_PASS) the dispatch-mechanism + env-var + crossover + pre/post per-BS tables.
- **`bottleneck_analysis.md`**: the literal `## Technology Landscape` heading, the `## Workload Dilution` and `## Top Components` tables (with `f_e2e` and the per-BS `decode_busy` / `decode_share_of_e2e` cells).
- **Rebuttals**: the `## Open Items Declaration` with literal `[NONE]` / `[UNADDRESSED_CRITIQUE]` / `[NEW_EVIDENCE]` tokens.
- **All artifacts**: every real number, evidence pointer (`file:line`, log path, trace ref), and per-BS data row.

Cut narration. Keep evidence. The labeled blocks are the proof — let them do the proving.

## Before vs after

> **Before** (real proposal prose, 78 words):
> **Provenance note (honest):** the isolated 1.25µs is 2.7× *faster* than the trace's 3.42µs (>10% divergence — so I do **NOT** claim "production conv = 1.25µs"). The isolated bench lacks production L2 pressure and uses a small hot conv_state cache, whereas production scatters conv_state across a large paged KV-cache. The ~2.2µs gap is therefore **paged-cache scatter / memory-latency + exposure, not body compute** — confirmed by the isolated body sitting exactly at the launch floor.

> **After** (24 words):
> Isolated conv1d body is 1.25µs vs the trace's 3.42µs (`conv1d_floor_bs1.log`). The 2.2µs gap is paged-cache scatter, not body compute — the isolated body sits at the launch floor.
