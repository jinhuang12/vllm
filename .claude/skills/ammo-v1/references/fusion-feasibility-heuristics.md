# Fusion Feasibility Heuristics

These heuristics are **filters**, not proofs. Their job is to reject fusion ideas that cannot plausibly beat baseline under **production parity** (CUDA graphs / torch.compile) because the *maximum* memory-hop savings are too small or the design is likely to underfill SMs / reduce occupancy.

## Inputs (per bucket, per rank)
- `M`: tokens on this rank for the bucket (decode: batch size; prefill: tokens in the microbatch)
- `top_k`: experts per token
- `P = M * top_k`: token–expert pairs processed on this rank
- `N`: MoE intermediate per partition for this rank (post-TP/EP)
- dtype sizes:
  - `b_mm1`: bytes/elt of W1 output (often BF16/FP16 = 2)
  - `b_act`: bytes/elt of activation output (often BF16/FP16 = 2)
  - `b_w2in`: bytes/elt of quantized W2 input (often FP8 = 1)
  - `b_scale`: bytes/elt of per-token scale (often FP32 = 4; sometimes FP16/BF16)

Also record the baseline “already fused?” checklist first (if baseline already fuses a hop, you do **not** count it as savings).

## H1: Memory-hop time-saved upper bound

### Step 1: Identify which hops the fusion removes
Common baseline pipeline (example):
- W1 GEMM produces `mm1_out[P, 2N]` in BF16
- activation produces `act_out[P, N]` in BF16
- quant produces `w2_in[P, N]` in FP8 + per-token scales

A fused W1-epilogue kernel that directly writes FP8 W2 input can remove:
- `mm1_out` write+read hop
- `act_out` write+read hop

A full fused kernel can additionally remove:
- `w2_in` write+read hop
- per-token scales write+read hop (if they exist and are no longer needed)

### Step 2: Compute bytes saved (count BOTH store + load)

**W1-epilogue fusion (remove mm1_out and act_out hops):**
- `bytes_saved_w1ep = 2 * P * (2N) * b_mm1  +  2 * P * (N) * b_act`
- Typical BF16 case: `b_mm1=b_act=2` ⇒ `bytes_saved_w1ep = 12 * P * N`

**Full fused kernel additional savings (remove w2_in + scales hops):**
- `bytes_saved_full ≈ bytes_saved_w1ep + 2 * P * N * b_w2in + 2 * P * b_scale`
- Typical FP8 + FP32 scale: `b_w2in=1, b_scale=4` ⇒ `bytes_saved_full ≈ 14 * P * N + 8 * P`

### Step 3: Convert to a time upper bound
Pick a conservative effective bandwidth:
- If you don’t have NCU yet: use `BW_eff = 1 TB/s` as a conservative Hopper-class back-of-envelope.
- Otherwise compute `BW_eff` from NCU for the relevant baseline kernels.

Then:
- `time_saved_max_us ≈ (bytes_saved / BW_eff) * 1e6`

### Gate
For the bucket(s) you’re optimizing:
- If `time_saved_max_us < 0.5 * required_savings_us` → fusion is **low probability** unless it is a “true epilogue” with no occupancy/grid regression.
- If `time_saved_max_us < 1–2 us` → treat as **not worth attempting** for decode unless you already have evidence the fused kernel matches baseline GEMM throughput.

## H2: DRAM vs L2 best-case and worst-case

Even if you remove a “global memory hop,” the real savings may be small if the intermediate is L2-resident.

Use NCU to determine if the intermediate is hitting DRAM:
- Collect for the baseline kernels involved in the hop:
  - DRAM bytes read/write
  - L2 bytes and hit rate
- If DRAM bytes attributable to the hop is near zero, your upside from “HBM savings” is intrinsically limited.

(Exact metric names vary; the principle is what matters: quantify DRAM traffic vs L2 traffic for the hop.)

---

## H3: W2-fusion ROI is usually tiny when K is large

Eliminating the W2-input activation hop saves `O(P*N)` bytes.

But W2 weight traffic per pair is `O(K*N)` bytes (FP8 weights), so at low reuse:
- savings ratio ≈ `(2*P*N) / (P*K*N) = 2 / K`

If `K` is thousands (common), this ratio is << 1%.
Conclusion: **don’t fuse W2 just to remove the intermediate** unless:
- you already have token-major ownership (no atomics),
- and you can keep the grid large and occupancy high.

## H4: Occupancy + underfill kill criteria

Any fused design that increases regs/SMEM can lose even if it removes hops.

Stop-ship signals (relative to baseline dominant GEMM):
- Active CTAs/SM drops by ≥ 1 step (e.g., 2→1 CTA/SM)
- Register spills appear
- Total grid is not “large” (e.g., not >> SM count) AND fusion adds significant per-CTA work

If any stop-ship signal triggers, pivot to:
- simpler split kernels + CUDA graphs, or
- partial fusion around baseline GEMMs.

## H5: Kernel-count wins require API time to be material

Under CUDA graphs, kernel launch overhead is reduced.
Only prioritize “reduce kernel count” if Nsight Systems shows CUDA API time is a material share of the target kernel subgraph (e.g., >5-10%).
Otherwise, focus on kernel-time reductions (tiling, occupancy, DRAM traffic).
